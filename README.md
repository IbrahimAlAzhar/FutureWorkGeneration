### Create a virtual environment: (Step 1): 
mkdir my_project 

cd my_project

### Activate the virtual environment (Step 2): 
env\Scripts\activate (windows)

source env/bin/activate

### install related libraries (Step 3):
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Prompt to refine ground truth future work by gpt 
  
    "Your task is to refine the "Future Work" section of a scientific article by extracting only sentences
    that are directly related to future research directions. Please focus on retaining content that discusses potential
    areas for future investigation, further research needed, or additional strategies to improve the current study." ```

 "Your task is to refine the "Future Work" section of a scientific article by extracting only sentences
    that are directly related to future research directions. Please focus on retaining content that discusses potential
    areas for future investigation, further research needed, or additional strategies to improve the current study."

### Prompt for sending LLM feedback to model:

You are an AI model trained to analyze scientific content and provide high-quality future research suggestions. Below, you will find sections
      from a scientific article, along with a justification for improving the "Future Work" section. Please use the article content and justification to generate an enhanced
      "Future Work" section that addresses the limitations mentioned.

      Your goal is to create a cohesive, logically structured, and engaging "Future Work" section that aligns closely with the article's content.
      The suggestion should also consider areas of improvement outlined in the justification, such as Coherence and Logic, Relevance and Accuracy, Readability and Style,
      Grammatical Correctness, and precision. Aim for a concise response within 100 words.

      Article Content:
      Abstract:
      "{abstract_text}"

      Introduction:
      "{introduction_text}"

      Conclusion:
      "{conclusion_text}"

      Justification:
      "{justification_text}"

      Based on the article content and the justification provided, generate an improved "Future Work" section that builds on the strengths of the original while addressing
      the noted weaknesses. Ensure your response is aligned with the main topic and presents clear directions for future research.

### Prompt to judge the machine generated texts and ground truth by LLM:
Title: Evaluation of Text Quality

Instructions:

You are provided with two texts for each pair: one is generated by a machine (Machine-Generated Text), and the other is the original or ground truth text (Ground Truth). Please read both texts carefully. After reviewing each text, assign a score from 1 to 5 based on the criteria outlined below. The score should reflect how well the machine-generated text compares to the ground truth, where 1 represents poor quality and 5 represents excellent quality that closely matches or even surpasses the ground truth in some aspects.

Scoring Criteria:
Coherence and Logic:

5: The text is exceptionally coherent; the ideas flow logically and are well connected.
3: The text is coherent but may have occasional lapses in logic or flow.
1: The text is disjointed or frequently illogical.
Relevance and Accuracy:

5: The text is completely relevant to the topic and accurate in all presented facts.
3: The text is generally relevant with minor factual errors or slight deviations from the topic.
1: The text often strays off topic or includes multiple factual inaccuracies.
Readability and Style:

5: The text is engaging, well-written, and stylistically consistent with the ground truth.
3: The text is readable but may lack flair or have minor stylistic inconsistencies.
1: The text is difficult to read or stylistically poor.
Grammatical Correctness:

5: The text is free from grammatical errors.
3: The text has occasional grammatical errors that do not impede understanding.
1: The text has frequent grammatical errors that hinder comprehension.
Overall Impression:

5: The text is of a quality that you would expect from a professional writer.
3: The text is acceptable but would benefit from further editing.
1: The text is of a quality that needs significant revision to be usable.
Task:

For each text pair:

Rate the Machine-Generated Text on each criterion and provide a final overall score out of 5.
Provide a brief justification for your scores, highlighting strengths and weaknesses observed in the machine-generated text relative to the ground truth.
Example of Usage:
Text Pair 1:

Machine-Generated Text: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog repeatedly."

Ground Truth: "A quick brown fox consistently jumps over the lazy dog."

Evaluation:

Coherence and Logic: 5
Relevance and Accuracy: 4
Readability and Style: 5
Grammatical Correctness: 5
Overall Impression: 5
Justification: The machine-generated text maintains the core message and style of the ground truth, presenting it coherently and engagingly. Minor variations in wording do not impact the overall quality or relevance of the message. """
